    <string-array name="details_agent">
        <item>Hailing from Accra, Ghana, Efia Danso is a Radiant with powers relating to cosmic energies, contained by a golden Guardian gauntlet. She uses these in her role as an astral guardian, ensuring that any universe-altering events do not have major consequences.
Recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as its sixteenth agent, "Astra", she continues to serve as an astral guardian in between her missions for the VP, though at times her two roles have come together. When the Protocol was keeping track of the fugitive Varun Batra whilst he was on the run from his former employer in Southern Asia, Astra discovered Batra was also in possession of a Guardian artifact, a set of five rings and a bracelet. Further compelled to bring him in, the VP was able to rescue and subsequently recruit Batra as agent "Harbor". With access to the bracelet, Astra was able to deduce from engravings left on it that it could function as a key to a lost Guardian city that she had never been able to find in her time as a Guardian. To her surprise however, Harbor revealed he had found it before; the "City of Flowers" was located in the Western Ghats of India, but Harbor had arrived there only to find it decimated and sabotaged.</item>
        <item>A criminal from Sweden, Erik Torsten was set to be convicted along with the rest of his family for their crimes. As he was a double congenital amputee however, the judge was pitiful and lenient towards him, giving him a smaller sentence that soon allowed Erik to return to his old ways. Building himself his own mechanical arms to use, Erik would hit back with his own criminal assignments, becoming so notorious for the terrible things he had done that he eventually had to go into hiding and effectively exile himself from his home. During these times, he also encountered the young Brazilian Tayane Alves, who worked alongside him for a while and provided some major upgrades to his arms, resulting in the carbon-steel titanium-plating version that he uses to this day.
Later approached to become a VALORANT agent, Torsten accepted the offer though his induction was not a smooth affair. Leaving behind his criminal life in line with VP procedure, his records were sealed and he became the Protocols thirteenth agent, "Breach". Despite now serving for the secret organization with more dignified actions however, the consequences of his criminal past forever remain, leaving him a man that, for all he does now, can still never truly return home.</item>
        <item>Liam "Brimstone" Byrne is the commander of the VALORANT Protocol, a secretive organization tasked with protecting Earth from cataclysmic disasters and dangerous situations involving radianite. A former firefighter and soldier from Baltimore, Byrne is fiercely loyal to all his allies and organizations, always keeps his squadmates close. But although he would do anything for them, Byrne hasnt always been able to save everyone. After the death of a close friend, Tariq Porter, his loss greatly affected Byrne, haunted by what had happened despite all his own best efforts to save him. It was around this time that he would then join Kingdom Corporation, giving him something at a time when he needed it most. Byrne would go on to become a veteran of Kingdoms K-SEC branch, once again developing a strong loyalty to his employer.
Shortly after the events of First Light the VALORANT Protocol was then founded, with Byrne leaving K-SEC to join forces with fellow Kingdom colleagues Sabine Callas, Klara Böhringer, and the phantom known as Omen, taking on an undercover life by the call sign "Brimstone". Under Brimstones leadership, the organization grew ever larger, recruiting more agents from across the globe as they worked to stop agents from the alternate-dimension Omega Earth from stealing radianite from Alpha. While operations were mostly successful and initially kept heavily compartmentalized even between agents, the failure of one particular mission in Venice and the catastrophe that occurred as a result caused VALORANT to reconsider its approach, moving forward with agents all getting to know one another and being assigned on strike teams together. All this time, Brimstones position has left him with more of a back-line presence, but life behind a desk has never been of interest to him, and he will still make sure to be present in the field from time to time.</item>
        <item>The Frenchman Vincent Fabron lives his life in search of one necessary goal, willing to sacrifice anything that gets in his way of achieving it. He has spent much of his time involved with combat and weapons, having worked for the French military before becoming a PMC marksman and then a weapons designer for Kingdom Defense. His employment at Kingdom was only a stepping stone for him though, as by this point he was already set on his path in pursuit of his sacred truth.

One such event that exemplified Fabrons will to continue with his goals no matter the cost surrounds his actions at the Everett-Linde Research Facility in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, where he traveled to around 9 AFL and began communicating with employees there. Fabron soon found himself barred from entering facility grounds shortly after attempting to access their systems but eventually returned to reinstate his security clearance and obtain schematics. However, he was soon forced to make a decision that required him to destroy the facilitys Large Radian Collider. Having already made contact with his Omega counterpart, together they fired on the LRC on the day the labs people were celebrating its supposed success. The resulting explosion killed many of its employees and the facility was reduced to a husk.</item>
        <item>Amir El Amari (Arabic: أمير العماري; meaning "prince of the moon") hails from Rabat, Morocco. Growing up and living there in poverty at times, his citys resources were depleted due to the activities of Kingdom Corporation in the area, with El Amari harboring a negative view towards them as a result. An information broker who is constantly gathering intel, El Amari mostly keeps the results of his work and his secrets close to his chest - especially those about himself. Going to great lengths to ensure no one can gather secrets on the man who knows all the secrets, El Amari has set up multiple safehouses in order to stay hidden as well as never going anywhere without wearing his black face-concealing mask. Even once recruited by the secretive VALORANT Protocol as its fifth agent, "Cypher", El Amari still keeps his face and identity hidden from his fellow agents. For now, nothing is worth the risk of removing his mask - not even for those closest to him.</item>
        <item>Han Sunwoo (Korean: 한선우) hails from South Korea, with possible links to the Insa-dong neighborhood in Seoul. As a chef in her early life, she was involved in an incident relating to her wind-like radiant powers at the restaurant she worked at, causing a "freak storm" that all but destroyed the building. Han fled the scene soon after.

Later on, Han would be recruited by the VALORANT Protocol to become its tenth agent, "Jett". Whilst working for the Protocol however, an incident occurred in Venice that destroyed part of the city. When authorities issued warrants for the arrests of the perpetrators, one of them was revealed to look exactly identical to Jett. Though Jett herself had nothing to do with the mission, the rest of the world now believed that she was a threat to them. She couldnt explain that it wasnt her to those she know outside of VALORANT, unable to even understand what was going on herself, and it left them feeling disgusted, horrified, and ashamed at her, forcing her to go on the run once more.</item>
        <item>A robot from an alternate future, KAY/O was created by the humans of that time to fight back against the radiants that they were at war with. Using the power of polarized radianite, KAY/O proved effective in shutting down radiants abilities, making them easier to eliminate. The radiant Reyna was of particularly high importance to KAY/O for her actions against humanity, and KAY/O was able to eventually eliminate her. However, at this point humans had already suffered severe losses.[1]

KAY/O would later on travel centuries back in time to the present day, arriving on an island near the Caribbean, and would soon be recruited as an agent of the VALORANT Protocol. He now fights as an agent in a time where there is harmony between humans and radiants, alongside alternate versions of both humans he served with and radiants he fought against. However, the scars from KAY/Os previous war remain, from the losses he endured and from the pain inflicted by versions of the same radiants he now finds himself working with.</item>
        <item>Klara Böhringer is an inventor from Germany who was born to one parent with Germanic ancestry. A nominee for the Distinguished Inventor award, Böhringer became the lead for Kingdoms R and D department at the age of 18. Incredibly successful, she had many breakthroughs during her time at Kingdom with several of her creations and innovations.[1]

Böhringer was the fourth agent to join the VALORANT Protocol as "Killjoy". She earned her call sign after her team initially used it to compliment her outstanding skills that reduced the amount of work the rest of them had to do, with Klara deciding to keep the nickname. Killjoy now continues her innovative work as an agent of VALORANT and the protégé of the organizations commander, Brimstone. From inventing spike defusers under pressure of an incoming detonation to building teleporters for transportation between worlds, any device the Protocol needs for any purpose - with the right tools, Killjoy can make it.</item>
        <item>Raised in Manila, Philippines, Tala Nicole Dimaapi Valdez is a Radiant empowered by her bioelectricity which has enlaced itself with Earths radianite mesh. A young but former veteran at K-SEC, she was recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as part of their Omega Project, specifically to utilize her electric abilities as they attempted to power an Alpha-Omega teleporter. Accepting a position there as their nineteenth agent, "Neon", Valdez left her home to join the Protocol and now seeks to help establish a stable connection that will finally allow the VP to cross over to Omega Earth.</item>
        <item>For many years the phantom radiant Omen had no memory of his past and how he came to be in his current state. Firstly working alongside Dr. Sabine Callas (one of his only apparent links to who he used to be) at Kingdom Corporation, he would then go on join her in the founding of the VALORANT Protocol. During his time as a secret agent, Omen was driven by his search to discover who he previously was. Without answers he was unable to find peace, his predicament being only a nightmare for him to live in.

It was then after over a decade of time that a path towards the truth finally appeared when the Protocol came across an hourglass symbol after one of their missions, something that immediately triggered a sense of recognition in Omen. Soon after, VALORANT then ended up meeting the person responsible for this symbol appearing, the young assassin Li Zhao Yu, who was recruited into the organization as "Iso". At first it was hard to get much information out of Iso as he shut down many queries about his own past, but eventually he came forward with his own truth; he had still been working undercover for his former employer, the Scions of Hourglass, and he had joined VALORANT in order to access his next target - Omen. It was only after seeing the differences between the two organizations that Iso had chosen to truly defect from the SoH instead as he had initially pretended to, and now he wanted to join in VALORANTs investigation into the SoH to uncover more about them. For Omen specifically however, it was an opportunity to finally get some answers on his past, starting with why this organization, one that Iso said that Omen used to work for too, wanted him dead.</item>
        <item>Hailing from the town of Severomorsk, in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, Sasha Novikov (Russian: Саша Новиков) is an archer who became an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as its sixth recruit, "Sova". With his right eye replaced with a mechanical one after he lost it, Sova primarily serves as the teams scout, gathering information and searching for targets using olden methods should technology come up short. Being highly capable and reliable both in the field and with his work, whilst also having experience with multiple radianite-related events (having traveled through a rift and having met his Omega counterpart), Sova has earned a reputation of being one of the Protocols most trusted agents, especially to the organizations commander, Brimstone.</item>
